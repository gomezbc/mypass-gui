# MyPass GUI

MyPass is a lightweight, cross-platform desktop application built using Tauri and Astro & Svelte as web technologies for the UI. It allows users to manage their passwords securely. All the credentials are stored encrypted in a MongoDB database.
The main goal of this project is to put in practice my knowledge of Rust and Tauri, and also to learn Astro and Svelte.

## Features

- Create, read, update and delete credentials.
- Generate random passwords.
- Copy credentials to the clipboard.
- Dark/Light mode (depends in your system settings).
